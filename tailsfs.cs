The only LLM powered parts would be me being too lazy to fix syntax errors and asking it to do it for me or not knowing how to do something (but not like teling it to make a entire filesystem like i did with BadFS*). TailsFS2 will probably be AI Assisted to fix FS issues. I'm stil learning here lol.
